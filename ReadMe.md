# How to use
#### MirrorEverything.html
Web to use to receive the tells
https://darkvamprism.github.io/AnylandWebCodeSnippets/mirrorEverything.html

The webpage listens for the following tell commands:
* `mirrorx` : Mirror all states of all parts along the X plane.
* `mirrory` : Mirror all states of all parts along the Y plane.
* `mirrorz` : Mirror all states of all parts along the Z plane.

* `mirrorleftright` : Swap all of the words `left` with the word `right` and viceversa in all scripts on all states of all parts.

* `wordleft AN EXAMPLE` : Sets the variable wordLeft to the value `AN EXAMPLE`.
* `wordright THIS IS` : Sets the variable wordLeft to the value `THIS IS`.
* `swapwords` : Finds all instances of wordLeft(in this case `AN EXAMPLE`) and replaces it with wordRight(in this case `THIS IS`) from all scripts on all states of all parts.
